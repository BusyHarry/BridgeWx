#V10.8.0  Monday Juli 21 2025
 - disabled v3.3.0 feature to show highlighted grid columnlabel on activating a cell
 - when producing builddate.h, 'prebuild.bat' now defaults to 'en_GB' locales for date and time
 - use ./build/msw/wx_setup.props to get the version-dependend names of some wx libraries
   - using '#include <msvc/wx/setup.h>' in main.cpp, all needed libs are auto-included, no need for above .props

   - remark: if 'wxwin'is set in the environment, the BridgeWx.props file is not loaded
 - changed disabled feature: 
   - bad side effect: columnheaders got a much larger margin, so many texts did not fit anymore
   - new implementation has nice side effect of having sort-icons available in the column headers
 - show messagebox after page has been setup to prevent msgbox on empty page
 - implementation of combi-table results and optimization of table displays in result pages

   - all functions are now static methods, so no polluting of global namespace
   - added scaling for the log-messages
